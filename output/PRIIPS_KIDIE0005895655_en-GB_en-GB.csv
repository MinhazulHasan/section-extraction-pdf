PRIIPSKIDTypeOption,"The Fund is an approved Fund of the Company which is authorised as a
UCITS by the Central Bank of Ireland."
PRIIPsKIDTerm,"This Fund has no maturity date and is not subject to any fixed term. The
Company may compulsorily repurchase all of the shares of the Fund or
the shares held by an investor under specific circumstances outlined in
the Prospectus in the sections ‘Mandatory repurchases’ and
‘Information exchange and the implementation of FATCA in Ireland’."
PRIIPsKIDObjective,"The Investment Objective:
The investment objective of the Fund is to achieve long term capital
growth by investing in ethically and ecologically orientated and socially
sustainable equity securities. To this end, the Fund will invest
exclusively in shares included in the Natur-Aktien-Index (NAI) (""NAI
companies"")
The Investment Policy:
The Fund is actively managed, whereby the investment manager does
not replicate the NAI but uses it exclusively as a source of ethically,
environmentally and socially sustainable shares; the NAI is therefore
the Fund's benchmark. The Fund is a financial product referred to in
Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 and Article 5 of Regulation (EU)
2020/852 (EU Taxonomy Regulation). Information about the sustainable
investment objective is available in Appendix 2, Part 1 to the
Prospectus. NAI companies are selected for their contribution to the
development of sustainable business styles via their products or
services, the product design and/or the technical or social management
of their production and distribution processes. In addition to
contributing to sustainable business styles, some of the investments in
the NAI companies contribute to one or more of the environmental
objectives listed in Article 9 Taxonomy Regulation (climate change
mitigation, climate change adaptation, sustainable use and protection
of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy,
pollution prevention and control and protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems). For example, the NAI Companies may
offer products or services related to (i) energy-efficient,
environmentally sound heat supply, propulsion and transportation
systems based on wind, sunlight, water, biomass or other renewable
energy sources, (ii) involve the construction of thermally efficient
buildings made of ecologically sound building materials, (iii) are
manufactured with minimal energy consumption, (iv) relating to the
production of agricultural products without the use of mineral fertilizer,
pesticides and genetically manipulated animals and plants, (v) relating
to the development and operation of resource efficient water
technology, (vi) manufactured using recycled or regenerative raw
materials, or (vii) reducing the use of harmful substances.
Income or capital gains generated by the assets held in the Fund will be
retained in the Fund.
Intended Investor:
The Fund is primarily aimed at socially, ethically and ecologically
oriented private investors who pursue the goal of asset formation or
asset optimization and want to invest for the long term. Investors

investor must be willing and able to accept substantial fluctuations in

PRIIPsKIDUnableToPayOut,"Bridge Fund Management Limited is unable to pay out?
For the protection of investors the Fund’s assets are held by an independent depositary Northern Trust Fiduciary Services (Ireland) Limited, so the
Fund's ability to pay out would not be affected by the insolvency of Bridge Fund Management Limited. If the Fund is terminated or wound up, the
assets will be liquidated, and you will receive an appropriate share of any proceeds but you may lose part or all of your investment. There is no
compensation scheme protecting you from this scenario."
PRIIPsKIDTakeMoneyOutEarly,"The Fund is not intended for short-term speculative purposes. The recommended holding period is at least 5 years. The Fund has daily liquidity and
in principle, investors may request the Company to repurchase shares on each trading day. Investors may request the repurchase of shares by
submitting an application on any Irish banking day before 4:00 p.m. (Dublin time) or 5:00 p.m. (Hamburg time). However, the repurchase may be
temporarily suspended by the Company if circumstances exist that require a suspension and this is justified taking into account the interests of the
investors. Further details can be found in the Prospectus in the section “Limitations on Repurchases“. No costs or fees are incurred for redemptions."
