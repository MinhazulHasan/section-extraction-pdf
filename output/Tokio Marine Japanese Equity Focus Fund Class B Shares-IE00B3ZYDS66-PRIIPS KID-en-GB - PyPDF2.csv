PRIIPsKIDOtherRisks,"Risk Indicator The summary risk indicator is a guide to the level of risk of this product 
compared to other products. It shows how likely it is that the product will 
lose money because of movements in the markets or because we are not 
able to pay you.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Lower risk Higher risk
The risk indicator assumes you keep the product for 5 
years. The actual risk can vary significantly if you cash in at an 
early stage and you might get back less.We have classified this product as 4 out of 7, which is “a medium” risk 
class. This rates the potential losses from future performance at a 
medium level, and poor market conditions could impact the ability for 
you to receive a positive return on your investment. Be aware of currency risk. You will receive payments in a different 
currency, so the final return you will get depends on the exchange rate 
between the two currencies. This risk is not considered in the indicator 
shown above. For other risks materially relevant to the product which 
are not taken into account in the summary risk indicator, please read the 
product’s Annual Report or Prospectus available at 
BBH.Dublin.TA@bbh.com. This product does not include any protection from future market 
performance so you could lose some or all of your investment.
