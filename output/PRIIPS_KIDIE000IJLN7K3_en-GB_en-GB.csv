PRIIPsKIDObjective,"The Fund aims to seek long-term capital appreciation
ASK Capital Management Pte. Ltd (the “Investment Manager”) intends
to achieve long-term capital appreciation of the Fund’s assets
by investing in equities and equity-related instruments, collective
investment schemes which are listed or traded on recognized
exchanges as well as money market instruments. These equities,
equity-related instruments and money market instruments will provide
exposure to India domiciled companies or companies that derive
substantial part of revenue from India and the Fund will invest in such
securities pursuant to obtaining registration as a Foreign Portfolio
Investor. Permissible equity investment includes common stock,
preferred stock, warrants and fully convertible debentures. Collective
investment schemes include money market funds, exchange traded
funds and index funds. The Investment Manager will select the equity,
equity-related instruments and money market instruments based on its
investment philosophy and investment process, as set out in the
sections of the Supplement entitled “Investment Philosophy” and
“Investment Process”. The Fund, from time to time will also invest in
initial public offerings (IPOs) to meet its investment objective. The Fund
may also invest in fixed income securities listed on recognised markets,
primarily in India. The Fund will invest in a broadly diversified range of
fixed income securities (including bonds, notes and/or bills) issued by
governments, institutions and corporations in India. The Fund will hold
fixed income securities with investment grade ratings (BBB- or above
by Moody’s / Standard and Poor’s or equivalent credit ratings as
determined by the Investment Manager). The Fund may hold up to 20%
of its net asset value in fixed income securities and money market
instruments if the Investment Manager believes that this is in the best
interest of shareholders. Investment in fixed income securities and
money market instruments will be for ancillary purposes only, for
liquidity and cash management purposes. Investments may be made up
to 10% in aggregate in unlisted equity and fixed income securities. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Fund will not invest more than 10% of its
net assets in aggregate in units of eligible collective investment
schemes (including money market funds). The Fund is actively managed
with a bottom-up stock selection process and the Investment Manager
has full discretion over the composition of its portfolio, subject to the
investment objective and policies of the Fund. For performance
reporting purposes, the benchmark against which the Fund’s
performance will be measured is the MSCI India Index. This is an
Accumulating class, any income or gains of the fund (net of expenses)
will be accumulated and reinvested into the NAV of the Fund."

price fluctuation. They should be willing and able to accept that their
