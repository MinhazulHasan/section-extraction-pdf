Lower risk
Higher risk
The risk indicator assumes you keep the product for 5
years.
The actual risk can vary significantly if you cash in at an
early stage and you might get back less.
!
We have classified this product as 4 out of 7, which is a medium risk
class. This rates the potential losses from future performance at a
medium level, and poor market conditions could impact the ability for
you to receive a positive return on your investment.
Be aware of currency risk. You will receive payments in a different
currency, so the final return you will get depends on the exchange rate
between the two currencies. This risk is not considered in the indicator
shown above. For other risks materially relevant to the product which
are not taken into account in the summary risk indicator, please read the

or

This product does not include any protection from future market
performance so you could lose some or all of your investment.
