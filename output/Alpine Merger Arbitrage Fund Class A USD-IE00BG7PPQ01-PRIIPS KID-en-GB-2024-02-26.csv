PRIIPsKIDTerm,"This Fund is an open-ended UCITS and has an indefinite duration. The
Fund may be terminated at any time in line with the constitutional
documents of the Company. For full investment objectives and policy
details, please refer to the Investment"
PRIIPsKIDObjective,"The investment objective is to seek capital appreciation. The Fund aims
to achieve this by utilizing a merger arbitrage strategy. This strategy
involves investing in a globally diversified portfolio of companies which
are involved in, or which are linked to, mergers and acquisitions. The
Fund shall primarily gain exposure to the global equity securities of the
companies, either directly or indirectly via derivatives. Also due to the
nature of the strategy, and to a limited extent, the Fund may also
receive other instruments including corporate bonds, private stock,
warrants and rights, etc.
The Fund is an actively managed fund which is not managed in
reference to a benchmark. The Fund may invest in emerging markets,
but no more than 20% is expected. The Fund may invest in other funds,
but only up to a limit of 10% of NAV. The Fund will take long and short
exposures which is typical of a merger arbitrage strategy.
The Fund's performance may be strongly influenced by movements in
FX rates. Please refer to the supplement and the prospectus for more
information. Leverage is employed by the Fund, the degree of which is
calculated using the absolute Value at Risk (VaR) methodology.
The Fund may invest in financial derivative instruments (which are
contracts between two or more parties whose price is determined
upon the future performance or outcome of a particular underlying
asset or group of assets). These are used to achieve indirect exposure
to a market, to achieve synthetic shorting, and are also used to manage
risk. These financial derivative instruments may include, but are not
limited to equity swaps, contracts for difference (CFDs), forwards and
futures. Please refer to the supplement of the prospectus for more
information."

PRIIPsKIDOtherRisks,"Risk Indicator
The summary risk indicator is a guide to the level of risk of this product
compared to other products. It shows how likely it is that the product
will lose money because of movements in the markets or because we
are not able to pay you.

Lower risk
Higher risk
The risk indicator assumes you keep the product for 5-10 years. The
actual risk can vary significantly if you cash in at an early stage and you
might get back less.
We have classified this product as 3 out of 7 which is a ""medium-low""
risk class. This rates the potential losses from future performance at a
medium-low level, and poor market conditions could impact the ability
for you to receive a positive return on your investment.
Be aware of currency risk. You will receive payments in a different
currency, so the final return you will get depends on the exchange rate
between the two currencies. This risk is not considered in the
indicator shown above.
For other risks materially relevant to the product which are not taken
into account in the summary risk indicator, please read the products
Annual Report or Prospectus available at https://sig-global.co.uk/. This
product does not include any protection from future market
performance so you could lose some or all of your investment.

PRIIPsKIDUnableToPayOut,"Bridge Fund Management Limited is unable to pay out?
For the protection of investors the funds assets are held by an independent depositary State Street Custodial Services (Ireland) Limited, so the
fund's ability to pay out would not be affected by the insolvency of Bridge Fund Management Limited. If the fund is terminated or wound up, the
assets will be liquidated, and you will receive an appropriate share of any proceeds but you may lose part or all of your investment. There is no
compensation scheme protecting you from this scenario."
