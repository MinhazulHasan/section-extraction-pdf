Type,This product is a UCITS Fund
Term,"This  Fund  is  an  open-ended  UCITS  and  has  an  indefinite  duration.  The 
Fund  may  be  terminated  at  any  time  in  line  with  the  constitutional 
documents  of  the  UCITS.  The  Fund's  assets  are  held  through  its 
Depositary, which is Northern Trust Fiduciary Services (Ireland) Limited."
Objective,"The  objective  of  Ennismore  European  Smaller  Companies  Fund  (the 
“Fund”)  is  to  generate  positive  returns  in  each  calendar  year  through 
capital  growth.  The  Fund  does  not  intend  to  distribute  income  to 
investors.
The  Fund  aims  to  achieve  its  objectives  primarily  by  investing  in  listed 
shares (or derivatives of such shares) issued by companies on European 
stock  exchanges  with  a  focus  on  companies  with  smaller  market 
capitalisations,  although  the  fund  may  invest  on  a  global  basis  and  in 
large companies. The Fund uses derivatives to obtain short exposure to 
individual  shares  (whereby  the  Fund  will  benefit  if  the  value  of  those 
shares falls).

The Fund is actively managed without reference to any benchmark and 
the investment portfolio is based upon analysis of individual companies. 
The level of exposure may vary significantly due to the balance of long 
and  short  positions  held  and  the  investment  opportunities  identified  by 
the Investment Manager. Net exposure (the value of long positions, less 
short  positions)  may  range  between  0%  and  120%  of  the  value  of  the 
Fund.
Depending  on  the  level  of  investment  in  shares  the  Fund  may  hold 
significant  cash  balances,  such  cash  may  be  invested  in  short  term 
government debt securities.
Shareholders  may  sell  their  shares  back  to  the  Fund  on  any  weekday 
which is not a public holiday in either Ireland or the UK."
Intended Investor,"This  Fund  may  not  be  appropriate  for  investors  who  plan  to  withdraw 
their  money 
less  than  three  years.  The  Investment  Manager 
recommends a minimum investment period of 5 years in the Fund.
The  latest  price  of  the  share  class  is  available  on  the  Financial  Times 
website and Bloomberg.

Risks and Returns,"Risk Indicator

We  have  classified  this  product  as  3  out  of  7,  which  is  “a  medium-low” 
risk  class.  This  rates  the  potential  losses  from  future  performance  at  a 
medium-low level, and poor market conditions are unlikely to impact the 
ability for you to receive a positive return on your investment. Be aware 
of currency risk. If you receive payments in a currency that is different to 
the product's base currency, the final return you will get depends on the 
exchange rate between the two currencies. This risk is not considered in 
the  indicator  shown  above.  For  other  risks  materially  relevant  to  the 
product which are not taken into account in the summary risk indicator, 
please  read  the  product’s  Annual  Report  or  Prospectus  available  at 
www.ennismorefunds.com.
This  product  does  not  include  any  protection  from  future  market 
performance so you could lose some or all of your investment.

Lower risk

Higher risk

The  risk  indicator  assumes  you  keep  the  product  for  5 
years.
The  actual  risk  can  vary  significantly  if  you  cash  in  at  an 
early stage and you might get back less.

Payment Issues,"Ennismore Smaller Companies Plc is unable to pay out?
You may face a financial loss should the Fund default on its obligations. There is no national compensation or guarantee scheme in place which may 
offset,  all  or  any  of,  this  loss.  The  asset  of  the  Fund  are  held  with  its  Depositary,  Northern  Trust  Fiduciary  Services  (Ireland)  Limited,  which  is  a 
seperate company. Should the Fund default, the Depositary would liquidate the investments and distribute the proceeds to the investors. In the worst 
case, however, you could lose your entire investment.
